# Exploratory Data Analysis of Unicorn Companies
![](Unicorn.jpg)
--------------------
In this project, I am a member of an analytics team that provides insights to an investing firm.

To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into unicorn companies (companies that are valued at over one billion dollars). 

The data for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their **industry**, **country**, **year founded**, and **select investors**. 

I used this information to gain insights into how and when companies reach this prestigious milestone and to make recommendations for next steps to the investing firm.
The Exploratory analysis is in the ![Python Notebook](Unicorn%20EDA.ipynb)
## Data Dictionary

This activity uses a dataset called ![](Unicorn_Companies.csv)
. It represents a list of private companies with a value of over $1 billion as of March 2022. The data includes the name of the country where the company was founded, its current valuation, funding, industry, top investors, year it was founded, and the year it reached a $1 billion valuation.

The dataset contains:

**1,074 rows** â€“ each row is a different company

**10 columns**
The data was taken from Kaggle.
